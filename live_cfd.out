2025-10-02T20:26:25Z INF Thank you for trying Cloudflare Tunnel. Doing so, without a Cloudflare account, is a quick way to experiment and try it out. However, be aware that these account-less Tunnels have no uptime guarantee, are subject to the Cloudflare Online Services Terms of Use (https://www.cloudflare.com/website-terms/), and Cloudflare reserves the right to investigate your use of Tunnels for violations of such terms. If you intend to use Tunnels in production you should use a pre-created named tunnel by following: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps

2025-10-03T13:33:46Z WRN If this log occurs persistently, and cloudflared is unable to connect to Cloudflare Network with `quic` protocol, then most likely your machine/network is getting its egress UDP to port 7844 (or others) blocked or dropped. Make sure to allow egress connectivity as per https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/ports-and-ips/
If you are using private routing to this Tunnel, then ICMP, UDP (and Private DNS Resolution) will not work unless your cloudflared can connect with Cloudflare Network with `quic`. connIndex=0 event=0 ip=198.41.192.47
